# Elinks configuration file.

#
# WARNING: Elinks is not safe to use with Tor because it leaks DNS requests
#          (it's also not recommended because an attacker can detect elinkse
#          because they act differently than Firefox - HTTP headers, etc.)!
#
#          There are two ways to fix the DNS problem. The simple solution is
#          to use `torsocks`. But that won't work if you want to use an
#          intermediate proxy which doesn't speak SOCKS. In this case you have
#          to patch the source. The following hacky patch "fixes" the problem
#          (by always resolving "localhost").
